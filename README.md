# Tree Component For AngularJS
Tree Control is an AngularJS component that cad add siblings, child and remove them. It doesn't depend on jQuery.

I have tried number of tree control but none is available out in open source community which can assist you to add siblings too. Since I want to control number of childs that can be added to single node. So I came up with my own tree control implementation.

### Features
- Data binding for the tree model
- Data binding for the selected node in the tree
- Adding siblings
- Customize number of childs to be added on a single node
- Remove node
- Recusive controller and Html code
- Can be customized with CSS
